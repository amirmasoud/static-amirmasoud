My name is Amirmasoo(ou)d, I've been doing these web stuffs from 2011. All thing started when I just wanted a website for myself. All of which led to learning more and learning more and doing projects for client and customers and getting hired to work on various projects and continue study and working and study and working and still, I am strugglig what is the best website for myself. Should I have this on my personal website? is it too much for a personal website? to show-off-i? does it worth it at all? So, here it is, scroll down and check it out, It can be show-off-i (personal website, duhh) and also a little bit trimed and adjusted. by the way, drop me an email, even if it's just a 'Hi', I would like to here about you!
