My name is Amirmasoud. I've been doing web development for years (since 2011). My career began when I just fancied a website for myself because I thought that's cool, I was a student, and I couldn't afford to hire someone to do it for me (let alone I didn't know who I should hire at all). These directed me to do it myself, learn more, and make projects for clients and customers, get hired to work on numerous projects, and continue the study and work. You can always drop me an email, even if it's just a 'Hi,' I would like to hear from you!
