My name is Amirmasoud. I've been doing web developing for years (since 2011). My story started when I just wanted a website for myself, because I thought that's cool, I was a student and I couldn't afford to hire someone to do it me (let alone I didn't know what should I hire at all). These led to do it myself and learning more and doing projects for clients and customers, getting hired to work on various projects, continuing the study and working. Still, I am struggling with the best website. Should I have this on my personal website? Is it too much for a personal website? To show-off-i? Does it worth it at all? So, here it is, scroll down and check it out; it can be show-off-i (personal website, duh) and also a little bit trimmed and adjusted. By the way, drop me an email, even if it's just a 'Hi,' I would like to hear from you!
