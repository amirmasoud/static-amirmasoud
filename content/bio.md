My name is Amirmasoo(ou)d. I've been doing these web kinds of stuff since 2011. All thing started when I just wanted a website for myself. These led to learning more and learning more and doing projects for clients and customers, getting hired to work on various projects, continuing the study and working and studying and working. Still, I am struggling with the best website. Should I have this on my personal website? Is it too much for a personal website? To show-off-i? Does it worth it at all? So, here it is, scroll down and check it out; it can be show-off-i (personal website, duh) and also a little bit trimmed and adjusted. By the way, drop me an email, even if it's just a 'Hi,' I would like to hear from you!
