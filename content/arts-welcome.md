My alternative life would be becoming an artist who lives in a shed an paints his life by a brush and steps back and take a deeper look at if it shows what it should show. Here are some, that imaginary artist also has camera to take amature photos. I also like to be a gamer, having a high end PC, playing various game as your full-time job and not leaving your home seems like a dream came true for me, but unfortunately, for me, I'm a potato.
