They say list your education and work experiences, so here they are. Am I fully proud of all of these educations and positions? I would get back to you with my answer to this question in 20 years, so tune in! There are always those short ones and long prominent ones, those you want to show and those you are not sure about them, here are mine. If you look closely you can tell there is/was always a struggle between education and career, I give you a hint, I have passion in web thingies, all things web, those things that can scale up and down, those things that can tell you what to do, those other things can out perform those other old stuffs, those new stuffs that no one except the demo repo uses and other things like these. Also I am stupid enough to jump right into new stuffs and give myself headache and pain, kind of fun at the end of the night.

Web thingies are mostly PHP, I didn't have decent computer back in 2011, it was a cheap 15" HP laptop with limited resources.
